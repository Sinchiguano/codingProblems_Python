#We've written the function, sort_with_bubbles, below. It takes
#in one list parameter, lst. However, there are two problems in
#our current code:
# - There's a missing line
# - There's a semantic error (the code does not raise an
#   error message, but it does not perform correctly)
#
#Find and fix these problems! Note that you should only need
#to change or add code where explicitly indicated.
#
#Hint: If you're stuck, use an example input list and trace
#the code and how it modifies your list on paper. For
#example, try writing out what happens to the following list:
#
#  [34, 16, 2, 78, 4, 6, 1]

    while swap_occurred:
        
        #Start off assuming a swap did not occur
