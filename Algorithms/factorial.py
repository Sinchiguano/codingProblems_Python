#Let's implement the factorial function
#
#Our factorial function should take as input a number, and
#it should return the product of that number times every
#number between itself and 1.

#Let's start with the function definition. This function
#definition creates the function factorial with one
#parameter, n.

def factorial(n):
    #What do we want to do inside the function? Well, there
    #are two cases. First, if n is 1, we just want to return
    #1. After all, 1! is 1.
    
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    #What if n doesn't equal 1, though? Then we want to
    #return n times the factorial of (n - 1). After all,
    #5! = 5 * 4!, 4! = 4 * 3!, etc.
    
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
    
    #If n is greater than 1, then it multiplies 1 by the
    #factorial of n - 1, as calculated with the same
    #function. Every time factorial() runs, n decreases
    #by 1, which guarantees that eventually, n will equal
    #1.

#Now let's test it out! Run this file to see the results.
print("5! is", factorial(5))
print("10! is", factorial(10))

#file, FactorialwithPrints.py, from the drop-down in the
#top left to see a version of this that traces the output.
