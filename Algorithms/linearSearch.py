#Write a function called linear() that takes two parameters
#- a list of strings and a string. Write this function so
#that it returns the first index at which the string is
#found within the list if the string is found, or False if
#it is not found. You do not need to worry about searching
#for the search string inside the individual strings within
#the list: for example, linear(["bobby", "fred"], "bob")
#should return False, but linear(["bob", "fred"], "bob")
#should return 0.
#
#Use a linear search algorithm (not as scary as it sounds).
#Do not use the list method index -- in this exercise,
#you're actually implementing the way the index method
#works!


#Write your code here!
def linear(a_list,number):
	for i in range(len(a_list)):
		if a_list[i]==number:
			return i
		else:
			continue


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: 3
