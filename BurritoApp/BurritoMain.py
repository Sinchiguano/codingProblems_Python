#
#Second, modify your getters and setters from your
#original code so that they still return the same value
#as before. get_rice(), for example, should still
#return "brown" for brown rice, False for no rice, etc.
#instead of returning the instance of Rice.
#
#Third, make sure that your get_cost function still
#works when you're done changing your code.
#
#Hint: When you're done, creating a new instance of
#Burrito with Burrito("pork", True, "brown", "pinto")
#should still work to create a new Burrito. The only
#thing changing is the internal reasoning of the
#Burrito class.
#
#Hint 2: Notice that the classes Meat, Beans, and Rice
#already contain the code to validate whether input is
#valid. So, your setters in the Burrito class no
#longer need to worry about that -- they can just pass
#their input to the set_value() methods for those
#classes.
#
#Hint 3: This exercise requires very little actual
#coding: you'll only write nine lines of new code, and
#those nine lines all replace existing lines of code
#in the constructor, getters, and setters of Burrito.
#
#You should not need to modify the code below.
