There are lots of places online to learn computing and programming. Many times, my explanations here might not connect with you -- if you find yourself confused, I'll conclude this repository with links to other resources so you can try out other explanations.
I've introduced you to Objects. I know this is a lot to digest so if you would like some additional resources, here are some places to start:

[Classes and Objects - the Basics](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/ClassesBasics/toctree.html) and [Classes and Objects - Digging a Little Deeper](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/ClassesDiggingDeeper/toctree.html), from How to Think Like a Computer Scientist
[LearnPython.org's practice problems on objects](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)
[CodeAcademy's introduction to objects](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python?composer_curriculum_redirect=python)

The coding problems were resolved by me, but the problem statements were done by the course I took part, better know as [Computing in Python IV: Objects & Algorithms from Georgia Tech](https://www.edx.org/course/computing-in-python-iv-objects-algorithms)
